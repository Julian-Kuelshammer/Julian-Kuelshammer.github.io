excerpt: 'We introduce higher dimensional analogues of the Nakayama algebras from the viewpoint of Iyama's higher Auslander--Reiten theory. More precisely, for each Nakayama algebra and each positive integer, we construct a finite dimensional algebra  having a distinguished cluster-tilting module whose endomorphism algebra is a higher dimensional analogue of the Auslander algebra of . We also construct higher dimensional analogues of the mesh category of type and the tubes.'

We introduce higher dimensional analogues of the Nakayama algebras from the viewpoint of Iyama's higher Auslander--Reiten theory. More precisely, for each Nakayama algebra and each positive integer, we construct a finite dimensional algebra having a distinguished cluster-tilting module whose endomorphism algebra is a higher dimensional analogue of the Auslander algebra of . We also construct higher dimensional analogues of the mesh category of type and the tubes.
