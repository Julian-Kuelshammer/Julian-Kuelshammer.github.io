permalink: /publication/2011-biserial-algebras-via-subalgebras-and-the-path-algebra-of-d4-1
excerpt: 'We give two new criteria for a basic algebra to be biserial. The first one states that an algebra is biserial iff all subalgebras of the form $eAe$ where $e$ is supported by at most $4$ vertices are biserial. The second one gives some condition on modules that must not exist for a biserial algebra. These modules have properties similar to the module with dimension vector for the path algebra of the quiver $D_4$. Both criteria generalize criteria for an algebra to be Nakayama. They rely on the description of a basic biserial algebra in terms of quiver and relations given by R. Vila-Freyer and W. Crawley-Boevey.'
