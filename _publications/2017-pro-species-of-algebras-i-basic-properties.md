excerpt: 'In this paper, we generalise part of the theory of hereditary algebras to the context of pro-species of algebras. Here, a pro-species is a generalisation of Gabriel’s concept of species gluing algebras via projective bimodules along a quiver to obtain a new algebra. This provides a categorical perspective on a recent paper by Geiß, Leclerc, and Schröer. In particular, we construct a corresponding preprojective algebra, and establish a theory of a separated pro-species yielding a stable equivalence between certain functorially finite subcategories.'

In this paper, we generalise part of the theory of hereditary algebras to the context of pro-species of algebras. Here, a pro-species is a generalisation of Gabriel’s concept of species gluing algebras via projective bimodules along a quiver to obtain a new algebra. This provides a categorical perspective on a recent paper by Geiß, Leclerc, and Schröer. In particular, we construct a corresponding preprojective algebra, and establish a theory of a separated pro-species yielding a stable equivalence between certain functorially finite subcategories.
