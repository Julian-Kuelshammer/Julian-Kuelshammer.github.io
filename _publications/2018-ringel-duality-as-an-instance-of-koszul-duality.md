excerpt: 'In joint work S. Koenig, S. Ovsienko and the second author showed that every quasi-hereditary algebra is Morita equivalent to the right algebra, i.e. the opposite algebra of the left dual, of a coring. Let $A$ be an associative algebra and $V$ an $A$-coring whose right algebra $R$ is quasi-hereditary. In this paper, we give a combinatorial description of an associative algebra $B$ and a $B$-coring $W$ whose right algebra is the Ringel dual of $R$. We apply our results in small examples to obtain restrictions on the $A_\infty$-structure of the Ext-algebra of standard modules over a class of quasi-hereditary algebras related to birational morphisms of smooth surfaces.'

In joint work S. Koenig, S. Ovsienko and the second author showed that every quasi-hereditary algebra is Morita equivalent to the right algebra, i.e. the opposite algebra of the left dual, of a coring. Let $A$ be an associative algebra and $V$ an $A$-coring whose right algebra $R$ is quasi-hereditary. In this paper, we give a combinatorial description of an associative algebra $B$ and a $B$-coring $W$ whose right algebra is the Ringel dual of $R$. We apply our results in small examples to obtain restrictions on the $A_\infty$-structure of the Ext-algebra of standard modules over a class of quasi-hereditary algebras related to birational morphisms of smooth surfaces.
