title: "Uniqueness of exact Borel subalgebras and bocses"
collection: publications
type: preprint
permalink: /publication/2022-uniqueness-of-quasi-hereditary-algebras-and-bocses
authors: 'Julian Külshammer and Vanessa Miemietz'
excerpt: 'Together with Koenig and Ovsienko, the first author showed that every quasi-hereditary algebra can be obtained as the (left or right) dual of a directed bocs. In this monograph, we prove that if one additionally assumes that the bocs is basic, a notion we define, then this bocs is unique up to isomorphism. This should be seen as a generalisation of the statement that the basic algebra of an arbitrary associative algebra is unique up to isomorphism. The proof associates to a given presentation of the bocs an $A_\infty$-structure on the $\operatorname{Ext}$-algebra of the standard modules of the corresponding quasi-hereditary algebra. Uniqueness then follows from an application of Kadeishvili&#39;s theorem.'

Together with Koenig and Ovsienko, the first author showed that every quasi-hereditary algebra can be obtained as the (left or right) dual of a directed bocs. In this monograph, we prove that if one additionally assumes that the bocs is basic, a notion we define, then this bocs is unique up to isomorphism. This should be seen as a generalisation of the statement that the basic algebra of an arbitrary associative algebra is unique up to isomorphism. The proof associates to a given presentation of the bocs an $A_\infty$-structure on the $\operatorname{Ext}$-algebra of the standard modules of the corresponding quasi-hereditary algebra. Uniqueness then follows from an application of Kadeishvili&#39;s theorem.
