Algebra and geometry group in Uppsala
=====

I am part of the Algebra and geometry group of Uppsala University which also includes [Veronica Crispin](https://katalog.uu.se/empinfo/?id=N10-872), [Martin Herschend](http://www2.math.uu.se/~martinh/), [Hankyung Ko](https://sites.google.com/view/hankyung-ko/home), and [Walter Mazorchuk](http://www2.math.uu.se/~mazor/) as permanent staff, and currently one postdoc and 9 PhD students. 

Currently, I supervise two PhD students, [Markus Thuresson](https://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N18-1281) (since Fall 2018) and [Anna Rodriguez](https://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N21-1628) (since Fall 2021). PhD theses in mathematics in Sweden usually take 5 years (including a 20% teaching load).  

Our group organises a [biweekly algebra seminar](http://www2.math.uu.se/~mazor/seminar.html) and together with some international colleagues we organise the [FD Seminar](https://www.fd-seminar.xyz/), a weekly online seminar on representation theory of finite dimensional algebras.
