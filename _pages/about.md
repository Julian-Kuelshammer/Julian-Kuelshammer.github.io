Algebra in Uppsala
=====

I am part of the Algebra, Logic and Representation theory group of Uppsala University which also includes [Seidon Alsaody](https://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N9-61), [Veronica Crispin](https://katalog.uu.se/empinfo/?id=N10-872), [Isac Hed√©n](https://sites.google.com/site/isacheden/), [Martin Herschend](http://www2.math.uu.se/~martinh/), [Hankyung Ko](https://sites.google.com/view/hankyung-ko/home), and [Walter Mazorchuk](http://www2.math.uu.se/~mazor/) as permanent staff, and currently one postdoc and 8 PhD students. 

Currently, I supervise two PhD students, [Anna Rodriguez Rasmussen](https://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N21-1628) (since Fall 2021) and [Jonthan Lindell](https://www.katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N20-1265) (since Fall 2023). PhD theses in mathematics in Sweden usually take 5 years (including a 20% teaching load).  

Our group organises a [biweekly algebra seminar](http://www2.math.uu.se/~mazor/seminar.html).
