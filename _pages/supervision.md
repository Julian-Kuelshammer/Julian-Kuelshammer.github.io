Current PhD students
======

PhD projects in Sweden usually take about 5 years, including a 20% teaching load. Somewhere roughly in the middle, a licenciate thesis is handed in. PhD positions are usually advertised by the department in March of each year. Feel free to contact me via email if you are interested in writing a PhD thesis with me.

### The Erdős--Kaplansky theorem

Prerequisites: _Linear algebra III, and some basic set theory like cardinal numbers_

It is known that for a finite-dimensional vector space $$V$$, the dimension of $$V$$ is equal to the dimension of its dual space $$V^*$$. This is not longer true for infinite-dimensional vector spaces. The goal of this thesis project is to properly define the notion of dimension for infinite-dimensional vector spaces and, building on this, study the Erdős--Kaplansky theorem, which gives an answer to the question of what th dimension of $$V^*$$ is in case $$V$$ is infinite dimensional.
